Course for Beginner's Guide to IoT and Hardware Hacking

The Beginner’s Guide to IoT and Hardware Hacking course teaches foundational skills and techniques required to get started performing security research and testing on IoT devices and hardware. This course focuses mainly on the hardware aspects of IoT hacking and how to use the underlying access to physical hardware to aid in and amplify the ability to hunt for vulnerabilities. While this course is a “beginners” level for IoT and Hardware Hacking the difficulty level as an overall cybersecurity course is intermediate. This course is open to everyone but has been specifically created for students who are familiar with software-based penetration testing (such as network, web and mobile) and want to learn how to bridge those skills over to IoT and Hardware testing.
